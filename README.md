Developer at The Onion
=======================

We're a team of flexible, passionate coders, and our websites deliver a combined 100 million pageviews per month. As we have a small team (currently six developers), it's important that we produce simple, reliable, well-tested code, and we're looking for an enthusiastic, experienced developer to help us in that mission.

We provision and maintain our own servers with Ansible. For storage, we use Postgres and ElasticSearch. Our sites are powered by Django, and we have a CMS built with AngularJS. The front end of our site is built with HTML5, jQuery, less, and all the jQuery plugins you know and love. Our code is hosted on github.

We're looking for someone who can bring:

  - Good programming fundamentals.
  - A willingness to adapt to our tech, and style of development.
  - New ideas, and an ability to argue for them.
  - A desire to build great products.

If this sounds like you (or you have questions), we'd love to hear from you! In your cover letter, please include:

 - Some background on your favorite technologies, and what you've built with them.
 - A link where we can see some of your code (ours is at https://github.com/theonion).
 - A link to your favorite Onion article.
