Developer at The Onion
=======================

We're a team of flexible, passionate coders, and our websites deliver a combined 100 million pageviews per month. As we're a small team (currently six developers), it's important that we produce simple, reliable, well-tested code, and we're looking for an enthusiastic, experienced developer to help us in that mission.

We provision and maintain our own servers with Ansible. For storage, we use Postgres and ElasticSearch. Our sites are powered by Django, and we have a CMS built with AngularJS.

We're looking for someone who has a competency in one or more layers of our stack, and a drive to build great products. If this sounds like you, please submit your resume to us. In your cover letter, please include:

 - Some information about why you think you'd be a good fit
 - A link where we can see some of your code (ours is at https://github.com/theonion).
 - A link to your favorite Onion article.
